* To Do
  - Syntax for special characters '\0'
  - maybe make "void" optional for functions?
  - inc, dec, pre-inc?, pre-dec?
  - maybe add! and sub! for += and -= ?
  - access/pass things by reference? Is that a thing in C?
  - function pointers
  - lambdas
  - closures
  - generics?
  - type inference?
