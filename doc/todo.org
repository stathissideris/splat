* TODO
- do blocks
- Syntax for pointer to pointer
- Syntax for high dimensional arrays
- Syntax for special characters '\0'
- maybe make "void" optional for functions?
- macro system
- inc, dec, pre-inc?, pre-dec?
- maybe add! and sub! for += and -= ?
- sizeof does not work well on kebab-case vars
- "deref" of pointers
- access/pass things by reference? Is that a thing in C?
