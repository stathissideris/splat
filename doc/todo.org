* To Do
  - Syntax for special characters '\0'
  - maybe make "void" optional for functions?
  - inc, dec, pre-inc?, pre-dec?
  - maybe add! and sub! for += and -= ?
  - access/pass things by reference? Is that a thing in C?
  - make the function's last statement to automatically be returned if
    it isn't void
  - change (if) into the ?: operator if both else and then are
    expressions/literals (of the same type?)
  - generics
  - closures
  - complete type inference?
